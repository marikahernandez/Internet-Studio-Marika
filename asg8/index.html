	<h1>darkbakerycreates.store</h1>
	<h2>Vampybakeshour.store</h1>
	<h3>Witchybakesandcreates.store</h1>

	<p>I talked with a classmate outside of class and we think that darkbakerycreates.store is a good title for my webpage because it can help briing the aethetic of vampire/goth into the baking concepts and ideas. This title helps represents both concepts together and is a good in between idea for both baking and the vampire aesthetic. We discussed also that the .store tag to the end was the cheapest compared to the other options that were popping up. Although my webpage is a idea for people to refer too, it can also serve as a store if I were to charge for the baking ideas but I think for now this is cheapest option that can fit the best.</p>
	
	<p> I like this domain name the best too because it i like the simplicity the name has to it and the whole vibe fits the concept for my ideas. I think this could be a nice name to use, because there can also be a opposite website with a name like softbakerycreates and it could consist of more pink and vanilla colors and pasteries to it's site, while mine is the dark more gothic ideas. It's simply and easy to remember and easy to type in, which I belive these are all very important things to have for a website</p>
