	<h1><a href= "https://kprofiles.com/xdinary-heroes-members-profile/" target="_blank">Xdinary Heroes</a> </h1>
	<h3>This is a 6 member korean rock band- that includes members Gunil (drummer), Jungsu (keyboard- main vocalist), Gaon (guitarist - vocalist), O.de(synthesizer- rapper), Junhan( main guitarist) and Jooyeon(main vocalist- bassist). They are a band under the sub-company STUDIO J, that is under the head company JYP Entertainment. They debuted on December 6, 2021, with their first single, Happy Death Day. They have peformed on many music peformance stages, but recently peformed at lollapoolza in chicago this past August 2025.</h3>

	<p>The reason why xdinary heroes is my favorite band is because I really like the uniqueness of each member and the talent that all bring together to create their own unique rock sound. I grew up listening to rock music and heavy metal because of my mom, but as I grew older and discovered my own music taste, I started to gravitate towards alternative rock music and finding them was like a special gem. I really like how each member has their own style while peforming on stage, its really captivaing watching them peform and seeing how each member feels the music differently.</p>
