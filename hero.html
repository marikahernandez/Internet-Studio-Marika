<p>The Lego Batman is animated superhero, based on characters created by DC Comics and the Lego Batman toy line. The Lego Batman character is a comedic, self-important, and childish version of Batman from The LEGO Movie franchise and its spin-off, <p><a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lego_Batman_Movie" target="_blank">The LEGO Batman Movie</a> voiced by Will Arnett. While still a billionaire crime-fighter defending Gotham, he is driven by a constant need for validation and often struggles with loneliness, leading to a focus on his solo heroism until he reluctantly builds a family with Robin and the others.</p>
<p> Development of The Lego Batman Movie started in October 2014, after Warner Bros. announced several Lego films, following the critical and commercial success of The Lego Movie. Chris McKay was hired to direct after being replaced by Rob Schrab as director of the sequel to The Lego Movie, who then cited both The Naked Gun and the Airplane! as his main inspirations while casting calls began in July to November 2015. The film pays homage to previous Batman media and also features characters from other notable franchises and film series with them.</p>
