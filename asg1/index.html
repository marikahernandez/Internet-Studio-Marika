	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>I have learned a lot of information from the readings but the main takeaways I have learned is starting from the standards and learning to keep the foundation work simple and organized well when going into coding. I also learned that designing with intent and keep things in a well organized manner. 
		I also learned that being able to keep learning information as it comes, and learning to adapt to new attachments is good for being able to adjust to new learning habits. Lastly I learned to experiment and keep an open minf when coding and creating your websites, don't be afraid to try new things and make things weird.</p>

<h2>Semester 2 Project</h2>
	<p>I have thought about my semester project for a little while not and I am not sure what I want to do yet, I am still a little confused on the topic and the theme I want to do just because I can't think of anything super creative just yet. 
	I wanted to tie it with something of my interest in music and different genres. I really like creating playlist and matching them with different emotions and scenarios. I was thinking maybe something along that route of creativity. But I want 
	to brainstorm a bit further and maybe get some more ideas about how to do that. I was inspired by the camera equipment website you showed so maybe I can steer it in n a direction that way.
