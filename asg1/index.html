	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>I have thought about my semester project for a little while not and I am not sure what I want to do yet, I am still a little confused on the topic and the theme I want to do just because I can't think of anything super creative just yet. 
	I wanted to tie it with something of my interest in music and different genres. I really like creating playlist and matching them with different emotions and scenarios. I was thinking maybe something along that route of creativity. But I want 
	to brainstorm a bit further and maybe get some more ideas about how to do that. I was inspired by the camera equipment website you showed so maybe I can steer it in n a direction that way.</p>
