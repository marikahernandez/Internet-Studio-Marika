	<h2> For my webpage design, I wanted to follow the themes of vampire, gothic and ghoulish vibes that are represented in the anime. I am really drawn towards the gothic darker designs in general with color scales of black, red, whites, and grays and this anime does a great job of potraying those color scales in the aesthetics of the design. For the visuals of my design, I wanted all my colors to match with the aesthetic potrayed in the anime. I really like the darker colors and knew I wanted to incorporate them into my designs.

		<h2>For the interaction part of my design I wanted to make it super simple and easy to navigate. I liked the buttons style from when we did it in class, so I followed the same codes to help me create those for my webage. Each button is a easy way to navigate through to each page so this was the best way to help keep my design interactive but also simple.</h2>

		<h2> For my placement of images and buttons I wanted to keep them simple and the main focal point of each page. I liked the look of the buttons on the top of the page because it’s easier for the viewer to see them and naviagte through it. For my pictures just putting them in the center of each page became really helpful in just allowing the viewer to see them directly. Overall I am happy with how my website came about and each pages simplicity. I really like the design and themes of vampire goth, and tokyo ghoul is a great anime that puts those themes into place. <h2>
