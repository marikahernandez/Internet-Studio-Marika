<h1>1. Anteiku</h1>
<img src="images/coffeeshop.jpeg" width="200" height="350" class= "center" >
<p> This is a coffee shop in the anime that has a warm homely atmosphere, but it's actually a secret safe space for ghouls who cannot hunt humans in tokyo. The main floor is served as a public cafe to everyone in Tokyo, but the hidden basement serves as a place for the ghouls living space. But this cafe is very popular and it would be so cool to experience it all.</p>

<h1> 2. Big Girl Restaurant </h1>

<p> Big girl restaurant is the restaurant that has Kanekis favorite hamburgers, and his best friend Hide brings him a burger from this place after he became half-ghoul. This hamburger is a huge part of Kanekis story, because now that he's a half-ghoul he is repulsive towards human food and cannot eat it anymore. But this burger place would be fun to experience and try to see why it was once Kanekis favorite food. </p>

<h1> 3. Helter Skelter </h1>
<img src="images/helter.jpeg" width="200" height="350" class= "center" >
<p> This is a Bar in the anime that is based in the 14th Ward of Tokyo and is runned by the Ghoul Itori. She uses this bar as a base of information to collect data on the activites in the ghoul underworld. This place seems intimadating but it looks like it could be very interesting to see how this place is runned. </p>
